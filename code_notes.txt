1 Overall 
----------
  1. To run interactively without clustcmd just set JOBS and then
     execute the relevant script.  Something like:
 JOB = datenum(2011,2,10)
 rtp_core

2 CrIS 
-------

2.1 Problems 
=============

2.1.1 rtp/rtp_core.m 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Do not want to switch from sdr4 to sdr60 files automatically.
  - Profile attributes are incorrect (pattr).  Reason is in iudef, not
    udef.

2.2 Cleanups 
=============

2.3 Immediate Changes Needed 
=============================
  1. Update =cris/readers/readsdr_rtp= with updated reader that pulls
     in many more flags, etc.
  2. The rtp outputs contain something in prof.udef(1,:) that I cannot
     find in the code anywhere.  What is this, who and why is it set?
     The values go from 0:1.

2.4 Questions 
==============
  - Set output directory tree using variable =prod_dir=.  Set this in
    =cris/rtp/cris_paths.m=. Generally set to
    ='/asl/data/rtprod_cris'= but to ='/asl/data/rtprod_cris_test'=
    for testing.  This seems reasonable, you just need to change this
    when deploying a new version in the production tree if not set
    properly.
  - What does structmerge do?  Line 93 of =rtp/rtp_core.m=  

2.5 Observations 
=================

2.5.1 udefs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The defined udefs right now are:
  1. iudef(1,:) = Reason
  2. udef(10:12,:) = Spacecraft x,y,z positions
  3. udef(13,:) = Delta B(T) from xuniform.m

3 AIRS 
-------

3.1 Observations 
=================
 1. AIRS rtp need =mkmetadata.m= to be run, which gets the AIRS flags
    we need (that are not in AIRXBCAL).  It uses opendap, and can use
    pre-downloaded data if done.  That data is put in
    =/asl/data/airs/META_DATA= on taro.  I think =mkmetadata.m= can
    be run stand-alone, so Paul or I can run it before a disk is made
    for me during CrIS Cal/Val if the rtp files have not yet been
    made.

3.2 Cleanups 
=============
  1. There are two very similar and complicated Mfiles in =airs/utils=
     named =data_to_calnum_l1b.m= and =data_to_calnum_l1bcm.m=.  This
     is very dangerous, using such similar names and similar code.
     The \*libcm version contains rtime and granule as inputs, while
     \*l1b version does not.  This needs to be cleaned up.
  2. =airs/rtp/sarta_core.m= picks the SARTA versino based on date.
     Make sure that is what I want.  I think the SARTA versions should
     be in a separate input, not in the source code.
