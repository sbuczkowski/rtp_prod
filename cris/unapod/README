% MATLAB toolbox to remove Hamming apodization from radiance spectra
% computed with the UMBC April/November 2009 CrIS "g4" database.
% The code works as follows:
%
% 1) Spectra split into three bands with 4 guard channels
% at each end of each band.
%
% For each band:
%
% 2) First & last guard channels are repeated 6 times to create fake
%    channels extending the spectrum a little farther past the true
%    band edges.
%
% 3) A rolloff is applied to 8 channels (4 fake and 2 guard) at each
%    band edge.
%
% 4) The spectrum is converted to a interferogram using ifft.
%
% 5) The interferogram is divided by the Hamming apodization
%    function.
%
% 6) The interferogram is converted to spectra using fft.
